Pour 4 tbsp boiling water over the powder, stir and leave to infuse for 5 mins.\nHeat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium-high heat and cook the onions for 12-15 mins, until soft and lightly golden at the edges. Add the chicken and garlic, and season well. Stir, keeping an eye on the heat to make sure it doesn’t brown, for about 5 mins. This is to maintain the golden yellow colour of the saffron, which is important in Persian food.\nPour in just over half the saffron mixture into the chicken, then top up with just enough water from the kettle to cover all the chicken pieces, about 500ml. Simmer gently, uncovered, for 35-40 mins until the chicken is tender.\nMeanwhile, cook the rice in a large pan of boiling salted water for about 6 mins, or until the grains are elongated and white, but not fully cooked through. Immediately drain in a fine sieve and rinse well under cold running water to remove the starch, using your hands to sift through and make sure every grain is rinsed. Drain well and leave to rest for 10 mins, shaking off any excess water.\nRemove the chicken and onions to a plate using a slotted spoon, reserving the cooking liquid. Set aside.\nPour enough water into a non-stick pan (with a lid) to cover the base by about 1/2cm (do not use a cast-iron pan, as it will conduct too much heat and scorch the rice too quickly). Mix the yogurt with the remaining saffron, the oil and some salt, then pour this into the pan and stir into an even mixture.\nHalve the rice mixture and scatter (but do not compress) into the pan, ensuring it goes to the edge. Carefully lay the chicken and onions into the pan, then season with a little salt. Add the remaining rice on top. Wrap a cloth around the lid, then use it to tightly cover the pan. If using a gas hob, cook over the lowest heat for about 1 hr. If using induction, cook over a medium-high heat for 45 mins.\nMeanwhile, melt the butter in a pan, turn off the heat and fold in the barberries, pistachios, almonds and sugar, and set aside.\nTo serve, remove the lid from the pan and gently fold the nut and berry mixture into the rice. Serve most of the rice on a platter, then remove the tahdig (crispy crust), cut into triangles and put on top of the rice.

It’s not a traditional Chanukah bake, but works brilliantly", "instructions": "Heat the milk gently in a small pan until just warm. Put the yeast in a small bowl and add half the milk (ensuring that it is only lukewarm at the most) plus 1 tsp of the caster sugar. Mix well and leave for about 10 mins until foaming.\nIn a large bowl (or in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook) mix the flour, remaining sugar, a pinch of salt and the cinnamon. Once the yeast is foamy, add the remaining milk, egg and butter, and mix to bring together into a dough. Add a little more milk if the dough is dry or flour if too wet. It should be tacky but not too sticky. Shape into a ball, then knead by hand for about 15 mins (or 6 mins in a stand mixer) until you have a smooth, soft dough that springs back when pressed.\nReturn to the bowl and cover. Leave to prove for 2 hrs until roughly doubled in size, or leave at room temperature for 1 hr, then keep chilled overnight.\nIf the dough was chilled overnight, set aside at room temperature while you make the filling. Combine the mincemeat, apple and almonds in a small bowl. If the mincemeat is very loose, you may want to add a little more of the ground almonds.\nButter a 900g loaf tin, and line the base and sides with baking parchment, leaving an overhang to help lift the bread out later.\nTip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle about 50 x 30cm, with the long side facing you. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a border of about 1cm around the edge. Make sure it is spread out evenly and not in clumps.\nRoll up tightly from the longer side facing you into a sausage shape. If it is warm and becoming difficult to handle, carefully lift onto a piece of baking parchment and chill for 15 mins. To shape into a twisted plait, use a sharp knife to cut the dough in half lengthways down the centre so you have two long halves with the filling exposed, but leave the top 5cm intact. Place the two halves next to one another, open-side up, and cross them over at the top. Continue crossing them over one another to form the plait. Press in the opened layers if they are falling apart to keep the filling tidy. Seal and slightly compress the plait by pushing the ends inwards so it fits snugly in the baking tin. Leave to prove in a warm place for 1½-2 hrs or until doubled in size.\nHeat the oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4. Bake for about 30 mins until deep golden, turning the tin halfway through to make sure the babka cooks evenly. If the fruit is starting to catch, cover loosely with foil.\nWhen the babka is almost cooked, make the syrup. In a small pan, gently heat the sugar and 100ml water, plus the lemon zest and juice, and stir until the sugar is fully dissolved. Bring to the boil, and simmer for 3-4 mins, then remove from the heat. Remove the loaf from oven, brush sugar syrup all over the top, and leave to cool in the tin before serving.

Sit the beef fat-side up on a rack above a shallow tray and leave it uncovered in the fridge, then remove the next morning a few hours before you want to cook it.\nHeat the oven to 120C/100C fan/gas ½. Put the beef in the oven on its tray and roast for 3-4 hrs until the temperature on a digital cooking thermometer inserted in the middle of the joint reads 50C for rare, 55C for medium rare or 58C-60C for medium to medium-well. Cook it however you like it, but with this cut being a lean muscle with just fat over the top, we think medium-rare is perfect. After removing from the oven, cover with two layers of foil, then leave to rest at room temperature for up to 2 hrs.\nIf you want to make the flavoured butter, tip all the ingredients except the butter into a bowl or mini chopper along with a pinch of salt, and mix well until combined. Add the butter and blitz to fully combine. Scrape out onto a sheet of baking parchment, then roll into a log shape and twist the ends to seal. Chill for at least 2 hrs to allow the flavours to develop and the butter to firm up. Will keep frozen for up to a month.\nAbout 30 mins before you want to serve, turn the oven up to 240C/220C fan/gas 9 and heat for 10 mins. If you’ve made the butter, slice it into about 15 rounds and put on top of the beef.

Wrap in a clean tea towel to keep warm while you prepare the toppings. Brush the bars with a little more oil and add the bacon. Cook, brushing frequently with the maple syrup, for 2-3 mins until sticky and crisp. (If your grill bars are too wide, lay the bacon on a square of foil.)\nSpread some of the soured cream dressing over the base of each flatbread, then add the lettuce, tomatoes and bacon.
